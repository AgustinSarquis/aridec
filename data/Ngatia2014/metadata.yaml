        vegNote: The dominant woody vegetation includes Senegalia brevispica, Vachellia etbaica, S. mellifera, V. nilotica and V. gerrardii, Croton dichogamus, Grewia spp. and Rhus vulgaris. The herbaceous vegetation consists of a discontinuous layer of mostly perennial grasses, which include Pennisetum mezianum, Pennisetum stramineum, Digitaria milanjiana, and Cynodon dactylon
