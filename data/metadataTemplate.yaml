incubationInfo:
        incDesc: # Short description of the incubation setup and main treatments
        # These fields should all be one dimensional arrays. Values for experimental variables with multiple treatment levels should be entered in the variables section and left blank here
        replicates:
          value: # Number of replicates per treatment
        incubationTime: # length of incubation in days

variables: # These describe the columns of your timeSeries.csv file
        V1: # column 1
          name: # Name of first variable in the accompanying timeSeries.csv data file. The first variable must always be time.
          units: # Time units used in accompanying file. Usually "d" for days
        V2: # column 2
          name: # Name of second variable in accompanying file
          varDesc: # Description of the variable
          site: # Site where the incubated sample was collected
          experimentalTreatment: # 'experimentalTreatment' here is a place holder for treatments with multiple levels. Replace this word by any of the listed variables in incubationInfo above (temperature, moisture, etc.) and type treatment value (level) after colon. Note that units should be specified in the incubationInfo field above.

          units: # Units for 'gasMeasured' field
          statistic: # Leave blank if mean values. Other valid fields include: SD, SE, and none (if a single rep)
          primaryVariableName: # Links variable with associated time series data collected on the same sample e.g. SD data or 13C-CO2 data associated with mean CO2 data. Leave blank if there are no associated variables
