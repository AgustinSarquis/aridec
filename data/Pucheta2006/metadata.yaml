        country: Argentina # Name of country where site was conducted
        MAT: 18.46 # Mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius
        MAP: 140 # Mean annual precipitation in mm
        rainySeason: # Period of the year during which most precipitation occurs, i.e.: whole year, spring, summer, autumn, winter (if more than one use array format)
