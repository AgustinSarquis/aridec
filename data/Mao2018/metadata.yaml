 Experiment1:
  Description: "They conducted a field-based experiment in 2011 in the southeastern Horqin Sandy
Land, Northeast China, to investigate the effects of UV radiation, litter layer thickness, and their
interaction on the mass loss and chemical properties of decomposing litter from Xiaozhuan poplar
(Populus Ã— xiaozhuanica) and Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) plantation trees."
