        vegNote: dominant tree species is C. mopane, with lower frequencies of shrubs such as F. virosa, M. sericea and G. monticola. Dominatent perennial grasses are S. pappophoroides, H. contortus, B. radicans and Enneapogon scoparius and annuals such as C. virgata, T. berteronianus, A. adscensionis and D. aegyptium.
