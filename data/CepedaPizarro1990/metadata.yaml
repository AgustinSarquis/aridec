entryNote: The coordinates on the paper were wrong. We used the one we had from previous papers at the same site. They provide elevation data for only two of 6 sites, so we use an average value
study: Leaf litter from L. tridentata and one dominant species per site was incubated at six locations along a transect at the Chihuahuan Desert
