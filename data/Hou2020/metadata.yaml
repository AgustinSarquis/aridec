entryNote: rainy season may to august. Litterbags were filled with plot-specific litter for all 36 plots and placed back in the same plot of origin. Community-level litter was a plot-specific (and thus treatment-specific) representative mixture of the respective proportions of all occurring species in each plot
study: Litter from four species and a mixture of these under long-term simulation of six different rates of N deposition at a semi-arid grassland in Inner Mongolia. # Overall study description
