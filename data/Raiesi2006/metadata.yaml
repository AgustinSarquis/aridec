study: Aboveground litter decomposition of three dominant species (Agropyron intermedium, Hordeum bulbosum, and Juncus sp.) were studied using a litter bag experiment under field conditions in three range sites of Central Iran, a site with continuous grazing, a site ungrazed for 17 years with dominant woody species (80% cover), and a site ungrazed for 17 years with dominant pasture species (70% cover).
