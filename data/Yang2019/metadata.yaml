entryNote: MAT and MAP from NASA POWER. They presented means of the different treatment. Specific quality of the 12 species are on the paper. Nine replicates for diversity and five replicates for genotype experiment
study: they evaluate litter diversity effect on litter decomposition at both species diversity and genotypic diversity level within a species.
