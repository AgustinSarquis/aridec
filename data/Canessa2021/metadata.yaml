entryNote: List of 30 litter species at supplementary (table S3). They have data on more humid sites as well (not included here)  # Any notes or comments related to this entry.
study: They studied how microclimate (soil moisture and temperature) and litter traits interactively affect litter mass loss, by using a reciprocal litter translocation experiment along a large climatic gradient in Chile.  # Overall study description
