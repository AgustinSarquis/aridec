entryNote: They have litter crude fiber content values (lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose) as a whole that were not included in this entry.
           They classify their soils as Yermosols, Xerosols and Regosols, but they don't indicate the classification system.
           They used two mesh sizes but didn't include them in the analysis because the effect wasn't significant. The biggest one is included.
study: Leaf litter from 5 species was used in a decomposition experiment under two radiation and rainfall treatments
