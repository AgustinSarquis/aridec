        site: La Pampa # Names of individual sites, if one site, keep on this line, if multiple, use array format
              # These fields should be arrays of equal length to site array
        coordinates:
          latitude: -38.75 # Latitude in decimal units (check for negative that denotes southern hemisphere)

        country: Argentina # Name of country where site was conducted
        MAT: 15 # Mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius
        MAP: 400 # Mean annual precipitation in mm
        rainySeason: # Period of the year during which most precipitation occurs, i.e.: whole year, spring, summer, autumn, winter (if more than one use array format)
        elevation: 94 # Elevation of study site in meters above sea level
        landCover: grassland # Land cover of the site. Valid fields are: greenbelt, (abbandoned) farmland, mangrove forest, subalpine, shrubland, urban, sandland, forest, steppe, desert, grassland, savanna
        vegNote: The palatable grasses (S. clarazii, P. ligularis, S. tenuis, Piptochaetium napostaense) are the dominant species, but individuals and patches of unpalatable grasses (S. gynerioides, S. tenuissima, S. trichotoma, S. speciosa, S. brachichaeta) are common.
