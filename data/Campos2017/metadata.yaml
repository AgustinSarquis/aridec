entryNote: data are averaged for litter from three precipitation treatments. They used a double layer of 1.5 mm mesh for bags
study: decomposition of sagebrush leaf litter under precipitation treatments that consisted of a doubling of +200 mm added either in the cold-dormant season or in the growing season
