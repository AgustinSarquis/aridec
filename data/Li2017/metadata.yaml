entryNote: they used PVC cilinders filled with soil with litter on top of the soil surface
study: they conducted an in-situ soil column incubation experiment for 180 days to investigate the effects of soil drying-rewetting on leaf litter decomposition of Populus simonii and Pinus sylvestris varï¼Ž mongolica
