entryNote: decomposition was carried out inside plastic tubes with mesh on the bottom. There are two experiments, therefore there are two controls (V2 and V4)
study: V. myrtillus shrubs were grown under ambient and enhanced UV radiation and their leaf litter was incubated under ambient and enhanced UV radiation
