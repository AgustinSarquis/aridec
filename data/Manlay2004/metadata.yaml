entryNote: they used 2-5 g of roots per bag (left unspecified). We assume the second Combretum glutinosum in Table 3 is actually Combretum geitonophyllum. Altitude from Google Earth. They put soil in litter bags togerther with roots to avoid void spaces
study: Two mesh-bag experiments were conducted in two sites (dry and sub-humid tropical climates) in Senegal to assess the role of site-related factors (climate, macrofaunal activity) and root-related factors (tree species, root diameter) on the decomposition of tree roots after clearing of fallow vegetation
