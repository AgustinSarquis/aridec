          - 132.5 # Elevation of study site in meters above sea level
        landCover:
          - farmland
          - grassland # Land cover of the site. Valid fields are: greenbelt, (abbandoned) farmland, mangrove forest, subalpine, shrubland, urban, sandland, forest, steppe, desert, grassland, savanna
        vegNote:
          - L. leucocephala plantation with no other vegetation strata
          - Grazing land comprised of grasses and only scattered trees. Cymbopogon citratus and Heteropogon contortus are the dominant grasses. Other species are Aristida adscensionis, Chrysopogon fulvus, Crotalaria angulata, Indigofera aspalathoides and Tephrosia purpurea. Woody species are Azadirachta indica and Hardwickia binata.
