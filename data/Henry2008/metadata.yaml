study: decomposition of sun-exposed litter over summer

siteInfo:
        site: Jasper Ridge # Names of individual sites, if one site, keep on this line, if multiple, use array format
              # These fields should be arrays of equal length to site array
        coordinates:
          latitude: 37.4029306 # Latitude in decimal units (check for negative that denotes southern hemisphere)
          longitude: -122.244425 # Longitude in decimal units (check for negative that denotes western hemisphere)
        country: USA # Name of country where site was conducted
        MAT: 16.25 # Mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius
        MAP: 677 # Mean annual precipitation in mm
        rainySeason:
           - autumn
           - winter
           - spring # Period of the year during which most precipitation occurs, i.e.: whole year, spring, summer, autumn, winter (if more than one use array format)
        elevation: 120 # Elevation of study site in meters above sea level
        landCover: grassland # Land cover of the site. Valid fields are: greenbelt, (abbandoned) farmland, mangrove forest, subalpine, shrubland, urban, sandland, forest, steppe, desert, grassland, savanna
        vegNote: The annual non-native grasses A. barbata, A. fatua, B. hordeaceus and L. multiflorum dominate the site. Non-native forbs (G. dissectum, E. botrys and C. vesicaria) and native annual forbs (H. congesta and E. brachycarpum) also are present. Perennials constitute a low fraction of the biomass, with native grasses (D. californica and N. pulchra) often the most abundant perennials
