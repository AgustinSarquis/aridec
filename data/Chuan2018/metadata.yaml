entryNote: Only plant species present within a subregion were placed in litterbags at each site. The mean effect of grazing on litter decomposition at mixed-grass Prairie isn't available. # Any notes or comments related to this entry.
study:  They evaluate the effects of grazing on litter decomposition over 18 months across the Mixed-grass Prairie, Central Parkland, and Foothills Fescue natural subregions at Alberta, Canada # Overall study description
