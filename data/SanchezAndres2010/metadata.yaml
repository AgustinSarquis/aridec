siteInfo:
        site: Yaqui # Names of individual sites, if one site, keep on this line, if multiple, use array format
              # These fields should be arrays of equal length to site array
        coordinates:
          latitude: 27.7 # Latitude in decimal units (check for negative that denotes southern hemisphere)
