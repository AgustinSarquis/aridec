        vegNote: dominated by V. karroo , V. nilotica, V. gerrardii, V. rehmanniana, S. nigrescens and M. senegalensis. H. contortus, T. triandra and C. plurinodis with S. incrassata dominate the understorey vegetation. The most common mistletoes in the study site include E. ngamicum, P. kalachariensis and V. verrucosum
