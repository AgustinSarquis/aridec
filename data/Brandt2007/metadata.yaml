entryNote: They measured cellullose and hemicellulose but reported it as holocellulose. They say soils are Ustollic camborthids but don't specify the classification system
study: They examined the effect of altered levels of UV radiation and different amounts of precipitation on the decomposition rates of litter of contrasting C:N in a 3-year field experiment in a shortgrass steppe
