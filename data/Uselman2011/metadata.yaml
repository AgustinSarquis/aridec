study: Three leaf litter types differing in substrate quality were decomposed in the field and subjected to one of three light attenuation treatments

siteInfo:
        site: Great Basin # Names of individual sites, if one site, keep on this line, if multiple, use array format
              # These fields should be arrays of equal length to site array
        coordinates:
          latitude: 39.85 # Latitude in decimal units (check for negative that denotes southern hemisphere)
          longitude: -119.38 # Longitude in decimal units (check for negative that denotes western hemisphere)
        country: USA # Name of country where site was conducted
        MAT: 13.5 # Mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius
        MAP: 173 # Mean annual precipitation in mm
        rainySeason: winter # Period of the year during which most precipitation occurs, i.e.: whole year, spring, summer, autumn, winter (if more than one use array format)
        elevation: 1175 # Elevation of study site in meters above sea level
        landCover: desert # Land cover of the site. Valid fields are: greenbelt, (abbandoned) farmland, mangrove forest, subalpine, shrubland, urban, sandland, forest, steppe, desert, grassland, savanna
        vegNote: invaded by Tamarix, which is currently the dominant tree, although remnant populations of Populus fremontii and Salix exigua continue to persist
